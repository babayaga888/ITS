        <p class="content">We are a group of computer science students at Cor Jesu College who have created a rule-based tutoring system. Our names are Germel John Marata, John Patrick Embodo, Michael Vincent Guray, and Rojan.

            Our tutoring system is designed to provide a structured and personalized learning experience for students in a particular subject or domain. It uses a set of pre-defined rules and instructions to guide students through a sequence of learning activities or tasks, and to provide feedback and support based on their responses.
            
            We developed the tutoring system as a project for our computer science course. We used a programming language to encode the rules and instructions, and we used a local storage in Javascript to store and retrieve the instructional material and student responses. 
            
            We are proud of the tutoring system that we have created, and we believe that it has the potential to improve the learning experience for students in a variety of subjects and domains. We are excited to see how it will be used and expanded upon in the future.</p>
